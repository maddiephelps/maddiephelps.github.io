        <h2>Welcome to Ray Commons Apartments</h2>
        <p>Welcome to your new home at Ray Commons Apartments where history meets modern-day comfort. This 100+ year old hotel has been renovated with high-end appliances, counters, and tile everywhere to create a wonderful home with an industrial feel - concrete floors, high ceilings, and more.</p>
        <p>This building is a historic landmark, from the antique "Hotel" sign on the side to the original brick fa√ßade. Our building has a selection of studio, 1-bedroom, and 2-bedroom apartments. There is a state-of-the-art gym on the ground floor only for residents (you've probably seen it while driving past on Washington St) and a shared laundry room. Plenty of parking is available around the building.</p>
        <p>This building also combines small-town living with an urban feel, making it unique in ways we've never seen before. Step out of the building's front door onto bustling Washington St, which feels like a city center. Retail shops, restaurants, and bars dot the immediate landscape, and the consistent stream of people and cars creates that urban vibe; however, you can hop in your car and drive 5 minutes in most directions to find yourself in the country.</p>
        <p>Grab an apartment on the third or fourth floor and enjoy some of the most beautiful views in Eden.</p>
        <p>Our apartments range in price from $800/mo to $900/mo - check out the homes we currently have ready for move-in. If we are full, you can reach out to our wonderful management team to get on the waiting list for the next available home.</p>
