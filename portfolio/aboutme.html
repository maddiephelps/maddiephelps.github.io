<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello, I'm Maddie Phelps!</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 21-year-old college student majoring in Social Media and Digital Communication at High Point University.
                I am currently captain of the dance team, where I hone my leadership skills while balancing my academic and creative endeavors.

                In addition to my studies, I have experience working as an administrative assistant at Clay Realty Co., handling bill management and payments using AppFolio software. 
                I also teach dance as a substitute instructor and manage the front desk at B-viBe the Dance Movement.
